		<h1>Unit 7 - Securing systems and data</h1>
		<h2>Security threats</h2>

		<div class="hidetext animated zoomOutDown" id="text1">
			<p> The goals of security are integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The cost of lost assets must be balanced against the cost of securing the network; your company must decide how much risk it is willing to take.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Social engineering</h2>

			<p><em>Social engineering</em> is the equivalent of hacking vunerabilities in computer systems to gain access - except that it occurs in the world of people. Social engineering exploits trust between people to gain information that attackers can then use to gain access to computer systems (e.g., verbal trick, a hoax, believable lie, etc.) Goals of social engineering techniques include fraud, network intrusion, industrial espionage, identity theft, and a desire to disrupt a system or network. Social engineering techniques are often used when the attacker cannot find a way to penetrate the victim's system with other methods.</p>

		<h2>Malware</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image3">

		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated flipOutX" id="text3">
			<p>Security professionals have coined many names to describe malicious software. The broadest term is <em>malware</em> Viruses, worms, and Trojans are the most common types of malware. Some other common types are spam, adware, and grayware.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Rootkits</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image4">
			<img src="http://retrowaretv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/page-08b.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated lightSpeedOut" id="text4">
			<p>A rootkit is malware designed to give the user root (admin-level) access to a system. The term is sometimes applied to malware that actively hides its presence on the system, relocating itself in memory, reinstalling itself if removed, and so forth, even if it doesn't seek root access.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Phishing</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image5">
			<img src="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/images/phishing-cat-page.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated rotateOutDownRight" id="text5">
			<p>Phishing is an example of a social engineering attack. In phishing, hackers send e-mail messages or create Web sites that mimic a legitimate site to gather usernames and passwords. For example, an e-mail message might purport to come from a person's bank and request the user to log onto a Web site to perform account maintenance. In reality, the Web site would simply collect the person's username and password and present fake messages about the account maintenance.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Shoulder surfing</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image6">
			<img src="http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/common/tools/security_centre/img/css/identitythief/shoulder/shoulder-3.png"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated rollOut" id="text6">
			<p>Shoulder surfing is a social engineering attack in which someone attempts to observe secret information by looking over your shoulder. It can range from usernames, passwords, personal information, bank info, etc.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Spyware</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image7">
			<img src="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/spyware-3.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated zoomOutUp" id="text7">
			<p><em>Spyware</em> is software that gets installed on your system without your knowledge. I can cause a lot of problems for the user, including gathering personal or other sensitive information. Spyware can also change the computer's configuration. For example, it might change the home page in your browser. Also known as <em>adware</em> because it often displays advertisements.<br>
			<p>Spyware is often installed when you are installing another application, especially <strong>free</strong> applications that you download from the Internet. Sometimes the license agreement and privacy statement state that a particular program will be installed but most people tend not to read those documents very closely or don't recognize the program as spyware.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Viruses</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image8">
			<img src="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Computer-Virus.png"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated hinge" id="text8">
			<p>Viruses constitute one of the biggest threats to network security. Network administrators need to keep a constant lookout for them to prevent their spread. They are designed to replicate and infect computers when triggered by a specific event. The effect of some viruses is minimal and only an inconvenience, but others are more destructive and cause major problems, such as stealing personal information, deleting files, or slowing down entire systems. Viruses usually operate without the knowledge or desire of the computer user.<br></p>
			<p><strong>Two major characteristics:</strong><br>
			1. <em>The ability to replicate itself.</em><br>
			2. <em>The ability to attach itself to another computer file.</em></p>
		</div>
		<h2>Worms</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image9">
			<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-20Tc2hCEZrI/TtkR4Ly1zbI/AAAAAAAAAJo/Js7xW2-UMz8/s1600/task_manager-sm.gif"/>
		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated bounceOutUp" id="text9">
			<p><em>Worms</em> are programs that replicate themselves over the network. The replication is done without a user's intervention. A worm attaches itself to a file or packet on the network and travels of its own accord. It can copy itself to multiple computers, bringing the entire network down. One method worms use to spead themselves is to send an email to every contact in the infected user's address book. The intent of worm infliltration is to cause a malicious attack. Such an attack often uses up computer resources to the point that the system or even the entire network, can no longer function or is shut down.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Trojan horses</h2>
		<div class="image" id="image10">

		</div>
		<div class="hidetext animated flipOutY" id="text10">
			<p><em>Trojan horses</em> are delivery vehicles for destructive code. They appear to be harmless programs but are enemies in disguise. They can delete data, mail copies of themselves to e-mail address lists, steal personal information, and open up other computers for attack. Trojan horses are distributed via spam or through compromised Web sites.<br></p>
			<p>A <em><strong>logic bomb</strong></em> is code that is hidden within a program and designed to run when some condition is met. For example, the code might run on a particular date. Because a logic bomb is contained within another, presumably useful, program, you could consider it a type of Trojan horse.</p>
