		<h1>Unit 2 - Motherboards and CPUs</h1>
		<h2>Motherboards</h2>

			<p> The <em>motherboard</em> is the main circuit board in a personal computer. It's made up of various components, including the CPU and other electronic devices, wires, and adapter sockets to which additional circuit boards and devices can be attached. The motherboard is sometimes called the <em>system board</em> or <em>main board</em>. However, the latter term is typically used to describe the main circuit board in non-PC devices, such as alarm systems, televisions, and so forth.</p>

		<h2>Form Factor</h2>

			<p>The form factor of a motherboard is its size and shape. The standard ATX was created by Intel in 1996. In addition, the form factor describes the power supply and case that can be used with a motherboard. It also describes the general physical layout of the components on the motherboard.</p>

		<h2>Computer Buses</h2>

			<p>In computer technology, a <em>bus</em> is a communication pathway. A PC has multiple buses to enable communication among the various components of the PC. It is defined by various characteristics, including how many bits it can transmit at one time, which signaling techniques are used across it, and how fast it can transfer data.</p>

		<h2>Bus Types</h2>

			<p><strong>Address:</strong> The bus that transmits memory address between the CPU and the RAM. The memory controller also plays a crucial role between the RAM and the CPU.<br>
			<strong>Data:</strong> The bus that transfers data between the CPU and the RAM. It's known as the <em>system bus</em> or <em>system data bus</em>.<br>
			<strong>Expansion:</strong> The bus to which add-on adapter cards are connected in order to enhance the functionality of the PC.</p>
			<p><strong>Address and data buses:</strong><br>
			<em>Address buses</em> and <em>data buses</em> enable the basic operations of the CPU and its interactions with memory.</p>
			<p><strong>Expansion bus:</strong><br> 
			An <em>expansion bus</em> is the communications pathway over which non-core components of your computer interact with the CPU, memory, and other core components. For example, data sent to and from you computer's hard drive travels over an expansion bus.</p>
			<p><strong>KEY POINTS:</strong><br>
			- The address bus is used by the CPU to locate the physical address to communicate read/write commands.(unidirectional)<br>
			- A data bus can transfer data to and from the memory of a computer, or into or out of the CPU.(bidirectional)<br>
			- The expansion bus is a communication pathway for the non-core components of the PC. It provides information between the internal hardware, such as RAM or the CPU, and expansion devices such as the graphics card or sound card.<br>
			- The number of bits that can travel simultaneously down a bus is known as the bus width.</p>
